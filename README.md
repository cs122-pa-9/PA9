"Chess 2"

This was the final project my Computer Science 122 class. We decided to make a game of Chess, except all of the pieces are randomized.

For this project we used the SFML (simple fast media library) library -> https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php

I did not write all of the code for this project, there are comments denoting the sections that I worked on. The code that isn't marked as "written by me" is written by my 3 other teammates, although I forgot who wrote what. This project was done in my first year of college, my teammates did not know how to use git and github. I pasted in and debugged the code that they wrote.
